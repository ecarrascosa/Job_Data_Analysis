Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

YOUR TEAM


Nuna is building a software solution to enable value-based healthcare at scale. Value-based healthcare is an increasingly popular set of payment models where providers are paid based on financial and care outcomes (e.g. costs and quality) rather than volume of procedures. These value-based payment arrangements are transforming US healthcare, but operationalizing them is complex and challenging. Nuna's solution is aimed at automating these payment arrangements in an accurate, reliable, and transparent way building a high throughput data pipeline to calculate performance measures for providers, identify opportunities for improvement, and present these insights in an easily digestible way.

You will also interface with external clients and industry experts, as well as Nuna's internal Product and Design teams, to create products that enable the adoption of these value-based payment models at scale and improve healthcare providers' performance.

YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
Identify and understand client's needs and pain points in operationalizing value based payment arrangements. Translate them into tactical recommendations to support scoping and prioritization of development work.
Gather, interpret, and document methodologies and requirements specified by client or industry standards for calculating key components in value based arrangements then:
Work with the engineering team to build the right solution that meets the requirements
Collaborate with product, client management, engineering teams, and the client to verify and validate the implementation.
Present solutions to internal and external stakeholders, map client requirements to product capabilities, gather feedback, and iterate on methodologies and requirements.
Conduct quantitative and qualitative research to understand the healthcare industry and value payment market in support of longer term product strategy.
YOU BRING
Bachelor's degree or above in quantitative or engineering fields (Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Health/Medical Informatics, Computer Science, or similar)

From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.

Our current projects are focused on identifying emerging consumer trends in Search and YouTube usage relevant for marketers, and understanding diversity trends for advertising content, to help foster equitable representation of all audiences.

As a Data Analyst, you will evaluate and improve the data sets and pipelines that power our projects. You will bring scientific rigor and statistical methods to the challenges of data quality, insights and system performance to meet the users' high standards.

You will be expected to use machine learning and AI tools (e.g. TensorFlow) for projects. You will build and prototype analysis pipelines iteratively to provide insights at scale through external tools, reports as well as internal dashboards. You will develop comprehensive knowledge of Google data structures and metrics, advocating for changes where needed for product development. This includes data gathering and requirements specification, processing, analysis, ongoing deliverables, and presentations.

Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.
Responsibilities
Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems; apply advanced analytical methods as needed and work with large complex data sets.
Integrate new sources into existing data sets and perform new calculations, including production code to maintain, improve and optimize analysis at scale.
Create and track metrics about data pipelines and quality via dashboards. Identify quality issues, ensure they are visible to the appropriate stakeholders, and drive to resolution.
Prioritize and work well in an environment with competing demands from multiple stakeholders in Marketing.

At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Innovation: Each year, Crowe invests about two percent of firm revenue in new product development funding to develop ideas brought forward by its people. Building upon a foundation of deep industry specialization, Crowe professionals follow a detailed innovation road map to create original, practical solutions that help address their clients’ biggest challenges. This process allows them to see their ideas through from start to finish.

Mobility strategy: Rolled out more than two years ago, this strategy defied the norm of the professional services industry. It allows Crowe personnel to work where they’re most productive – whether that be the office, their home or elsewhere – and wear jeans while they’re in the office. This policy continues to receive great reviews on annual internal employee engagement surveys.

Benefits: The firm promotes healthy living through its internal well-being portal, which allows Crowe individuals to complete wellness activities – such as exercise challenges, healthy eating, doctor visits and mindful lifestyle changes – for gift cards and health insurance premium reductions. Additionally, on top of its healthcare and retirement programs, Crowe recently expanded its paid time off policies for military leave and all new parents.

Community service: Recently acknowledged in the Fortune Best Workplaces for Giving Back list, the firm places a high priority on community service. In honor of the firm’s 75th year, Crowe personnel not only achieved, but surpassed their goal of 75,000 hours of volunteering. We're proud to announce that we volunteered 82,000 hours – giving back to the communities where we live and work. That’s the equivalent of 39 full-time employees at the nonprofits we served! In addition, Crowe has policies in place to align its charitable contributions with the volunteer efforts of its people.

As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:
Languages: Python, Scala, and occasionally R and Node.js
Storage: Postgres, Redshift, S3
Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie
Nice to Have:
Familiarity with Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Looker, Superset
Domain experience developing software for Fintech, Banking, or related Consumer Financial Services companies
